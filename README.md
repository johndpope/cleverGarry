# Hey Dan!

I've added assets for the email section.  Have run out of time to thoroughly check through everythign and write detailed instructions, but sure I'll chat to ya on Wednesday anyway.
And by now you've prob noticed how I fucked myself by designing to iphone 6 screen not 5...round one, lesson learnt.  Doesn't really matter for this, we will demo to the NRMA on a 6 anyway - hopefully they'll be non the wiser.''

Guess who's on a fucking 'streak' on GitHub! User bobjmiles, that's who.  Get in early following that bloke.../prodigy'

Sorry mate, feel like I'm getting awkward with this favour now...only because I keep bloody asking!  I'm concerned this has become more development work than favour now.  Have a look around and see what yoy think anyway. We had a guy from the US, Eddy, knocking this up for us, but he's now too flat out to do anymore work which has kind of fucked us since NRMA presentation is next week... that said, he's done a bang up job thus far.  All this in 20hrs of work (though you're prob a better judge of that than I).  Will be curious to hear what you think of his code.

I'm probably best running you through all of it in person, perhaps Wednesday if you have the time, theres a few things on the wish list.
(a) first and foremost is distribution... actually getting it to the bastards
(b) I have kmls I'd like displayed on two of the map pages.  This might be a huge ball ache though, so can be knocked down the list
(c) I've been playing around with SendGrid to send an email from the app.  Have designed one view controller with 4 text fields and two pickers that'll populate dynamic fields in the HTML email (already written/have the code for it).  SendGrid has an iOS library that seems easy enough...but I have no idea.  Have managed to setup the account and use their web API to send emails, so hopefully its not too hard to do from an iOS app...

That's the bulk of it anyway.  There's a couple of other niggly little things if I can really stretch a favour, but would prefer not ask if there's a heap of work already...  I'll jot down far more detailed info soon, but keen to hear your gut feel on how much labour is involved with those 3 things.

Cheers Dan - enjoy your Aus day, speak to you soon.
